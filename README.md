This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to use the [unofficial ChatGPT API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) to generate code or natural language responses from OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to your questions, right within the editor.

Supercharge your coding with AI-powered assistance! Automatically write new code from scratch, ask questions, get explanations, refactor code, find bugs and more üöÄ‚ú®

#### üì¢ It works now (02/25/2023), with new features and new styles.

## Features
- üí° **Ask general questions** or use code snippets from the editor to query ChatGPT via an input box in the sidebar
- üñ±Ô∏è Right click on a code selection and run one of the context menu **shortcuts**
	- automatically write documentation for your code
	- explain the selected code
	- refactor or optimize it
	- find problems with it
- üíª View ChatGPT's responses in a panel next to the editor
- üöÄ See the response as it is being generated **in real time**
- üí¨ Ask **follow-up questions** to the response (conversation context is maintained)

## Installation

To use this extension, install it from the VSCode marketplace.

1. After the installation is complete, you will need to add your OpenAI API key to the extension settings in VSCode. To do this, open the `Settings` panel by going to the `File` menu and selecting `Preferences`, then `Settings`.
2. In the search bar, type `ChatGPT` to filter the settings list.
3. In the ChatGPT section, enter your API key in the top field

After completing these steps, the extension should be ready to use.

### Obtaining API key

To use this extension, you will need an API key from OpenAI. To obtain one, follow these steps:

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). If you don't have an account, you will need to create one or sign up using your Google or Microsoft account.
2. Click on the `Create new secret key` button.
3. Copy the key and paste it into the `API Key` field in the extension settings.

### Building from source (not applicable for VSCode marketplace version)

*Update: The model used in this extension was disabled. You can make it work by updating the `chatgpt` module to the newest version, however it will use GPT-3 instead of ChatGPT which means spending your OpenAI account's credits and worse performance.*

To build the extension from source, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You have to change some code in `chatgpt` module because VSCode runtime does not support `fetch`. Open `node_modules/chatgpt/dist/index.js` and add the following code at the top of the file:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
```

Then remove the following lines (around line 15):

```js
// src/fetch.ts
var fetch = globalThis.fetch;
if (typeof fetch !== "function") {
  throw new Error("Invalid environment: global fetch not defined");
}
```

You also need to copy `encoder.json` and `vocab.bpe` from `node_modules/gpt-3-encoder/` into `dist/` folder. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
cp node_modules/gpt-3-encoder/{encoder.json,vocab.bpe} dist/
```

## Using the Extension

To use the extension, open a text editor in Visual Studio Code and open the ChatGPT panel by clicking on the ChatGPT icon in the sidebar. This will open a panel with an input field where you can enter your prompt or question. By clicking enter, it will be sent to ChatGPT. Its response will be displayed below the input field in the sidebar (note that it may take some time for it to be calculated).

You can also select a code snippet in the editor and then enter a prompt in the side panel, or right-click and select "Ask ChatGPT". The **selected code will be automatically appended** to your query when it is sent to the AI. This can be useful for generating code snippets or getting explanations for specific pieces of code.

To **insert a code snippet** from the AI's response into the editor, simply click on the code block in the panel. The code will be automatically inserted at the cursor position in the active editor.

You can select some code in the editor, right click on it and choose one of the following **shortcuts** from the context menu:
#### Commands:
- `Ask ChatGPT`: will provide a prompt for you to enter any query
- `ChatGPT: Explain selection`: will explain what the selected code does
- `ChatGPT: Refactor selection`: will try to refactor the selected code
- `ChatGPT: Find problems`: looks for problems/errors in the selected code, fixes and explains them
- `ChatGPT: Optimize selection`: tries to optimize the selected code

`Ask ChatGPT` is also available when nothing is selected. For the other four commands, you can **customize the exact prompt** that will be sent to the AI by editing the extension settings in VSCode Preferences.


Because ChatGPT is a conversational AI, you can ask follow-up questions to the response. The conversation context is maintained between queries, so you can ask multiple questions in a row. 
To **reset the conversation context**, click `ctrl+shift+p` and select `ChatGPT: Reset Conversation`.
